						One government official told the BBC: "No one has full visibility on cyberspace threats. We see volumes of attack increase and we expect it to continue to rise."
						The plan - the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) - has emerged out of a 2012 pilot scheme known as Project Auburn.
						Eighty companies from five sectors of the economy - finance, defence, energy, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals - were encouraged to share information.	
						The pilot was expanded to 160 firms. A more permanent structure is being announced on Wednesday.
						The kind of information shared includes technical details of an attack, methods used in planning it and how to mitigate and deal with one.
						At a new London base, large screens will monitor attacks and provide details in real-time of who is being targeted.
						A group of 12-15 analysts with security clearance will work mainly during office hours.
						Companies previously have been nervous of revealing publicly when they have been attacked because of the potential impact on reputation and share price if they are seen as having lost valuable intellectual property or other information.
						It is hoped further firms will join the initial 160.

				Many analysts have said that a successful alliance with Emirates may help it cut flights further and focus on more profitable routes instead.
				They say that with Emirates flying to more than 70 destinations in Europe, any such move would be an easy one to make and would still help Qantas service its customers who fly to those destinations.
				Qantas has already said that it will stop flights to Frankfurt.
				Meanwhile, the alliance with Emirates will also see Qantas shift its hub for European flights to Dubai from Singapore.
